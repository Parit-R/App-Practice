1-Simple Weather App using API
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OpenWeatherMap API
2-Recipe Finder
Recipe finder can be a good project as a mini project for CS students. In recipe finder, we create a software application that is used to look for new recipes and the ingredients, new cuisines, and other things. Some functionalities like the search button, sorting according to the ingredients, filters for ingredients, and user accounts can be added to the project.
One needs to have a good hold on web technologies (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript), databases, and third-party APIs to build this application.
